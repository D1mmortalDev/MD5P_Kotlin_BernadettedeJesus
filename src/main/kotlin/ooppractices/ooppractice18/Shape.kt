//Create an interface called Shape with the following function:
//functions:
//fun calculateArea(): Double
//Create two classes called Circle and Rectangle that implement the Shape interface. In each class, implement the calculateArea() function to calculate and return the area of a circle and a rectangle, respectively.
//In the main() function, create instances of Circle and Rectangle, set their dimensions, and call the calculateArea() function for each shape. Print the calculated areas.
